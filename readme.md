# JAVASCRIPT CAPSTONE PROJECT

The JavaScript capstone project is about building your own web application based on an external API. You will select an API that provides data about a topic that you like and then build the webapp around it. The webapp will have 2 or 3 user interfaces. In this case we have chosen a <a href="https://www.tvmaze.com/api">TVMAZE API</a>
